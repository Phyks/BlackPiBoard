BlackPiBoard
============

A blackboard using a Raspberry Pi and a pico-projector !

## Setup
I had a Raspberry Pi, an old videoprojector and a Wacom tablet lying around and
search for something cool to do with them. So, I decided to make an interactive
blackboard.

The base code is minimalist for now, but I will develop it in the future.

So, basically, you just have to connect the Wacom tablet and the videoprojector
to the Raspberry Pi and launch the script.

More details coming when I'll have tested it a bit more ! Don't worry to ask
for more information if not coming fast enough or if you are interested.

## LICENSE

**Note :** The original code was found here: http://compsci.ca/v3/viewtopic.php?t=32343.
I reused his code which was a good base for my code, but don't have any ways to
contact him and no information on the license. So, the following only apply to
my personnal modifications of the code.

TLDR; I don't give a damn to anything you can do using this code (but please,
tell me if you do anything cool :). It would just be nice to quote where the
original code comes from.
